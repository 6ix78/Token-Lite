                     <p>Tokenization is technology that allows you to split the ownership of a business, intellectual property, or any kind of asset into a fractional number of pieces (tokens); like shares of a company. Tokenization enables us to democratize investing, and allow anyone with a business idea to be supported by the global community. </p>

                                            3.0. People, brands & companies can essentially tokenize their business with our
                                            technology. This means they can take something (anything) and split its ownership into a
                                            finite number of tokens; similar to shares in a company.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="mb-3 fs-14">Now, take a house for example. Normally, one or a few people purchase a house & it
                                            costs them hundreds of thousands. With tokenization, the ownership of this house can
                                            be split into thousands of pieces, be sold to thousands of buyers, and each person
                                            would own a piece of real estate for only a few hundred dollars. These buyers can then
                                            benefit from the rental income the house generates and are also free to sell their piece
                                            at any time on the open market.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="mb-3 fs-14">The same is true for a business. Split your company into thousands of pieces, allow
                                            investors to come in at a low price, and get access to capital faster from an international
                                            investment pool. All of this is done securely through the Web3; as security &
                                            legitimacy is the foundation of the technology. As an investor, you truly own a share of
                                            the house and the business you buy into. As a seller, you receive real dollars in
                                            exchange for tokenized pieces of your business or assets.
